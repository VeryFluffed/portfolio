                        Danh (Yah-n) is a Vietnamese name, meaning reputation, prestige, courage,
                        and funnily enough, name. Born and raised in an immigrant Vietnamese
                        household in Orange County, California, I have been instilled with <a className="bold"> hard
                        work and persistence.</a> I have since lived in Fountain Valley, where I
                        spend most of my days working on projects that blend software, hardware,
                        and mechanical design into complete systems.

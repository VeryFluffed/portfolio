                        What began as redstone contraptions and teamwork online evolved into real-world engineering
                        challenges. I first took my skills from Minecraft and translated it to real life with art.
                        Since then, I started working on larger projects, such as building an <a className="bold"> electric go-kart</a> out of a
                        bed frame, designing a competitive <a className="bold"> pickleball machine</a> as a tennis player, and
                        <a className="bold"> 3D printing</a> to
                        bring a Minecraft jukebox to life. Like my initial interest in Minecraft, Iâ€™ve naturally chased
                        projects that forced me to learn new skills, adapt to limitations (budget :C), and communicate
                        to professionals.
